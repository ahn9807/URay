## Ray Traycer 
This is my personal projects for building physically accurate path traycer for Unity. I plan to make path traycer which could rendering all the unity's object with easy and simple steps. My ultimate goal is making raytracer for rendering scene of unity just like that of blender. 

## Current showcases

## To do

- [x] Principle materials (Diffuse, Dielectric, Mirror)
- [x] Brute force integration
- [ ] Emission based sampling
- [ ] Multiple importance sampling
- [ ] Volumetric rendering
- [ ] Denoising 
- [ ] Advanced materials (Disney...)
- [ ] Enviroment Light
- [ ] Texturing
- [ ] Accelerate rendering speed
- [ ] Make robust acceleration structure for raycasting (60 times slower compare to unity's built in raycast)
- [ ] Add shader for preview materials
- [ ] And more?
